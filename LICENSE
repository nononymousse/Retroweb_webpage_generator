 	These are the licensing terms of the thing (program, tool, media, whatever it is attached to) you downloaded.
	Please respect them, but I don’t have anyway nor energy to enforce them so be respectul of it
	
	1. Do whatever.
	   Seriously, if you want to use this do it. Have fun.
	   Ask questions if you need, but you’ll have to wait bc I’m burned out so I’m likely to either reply very late or not at all.
	   Complain to the system for this. (or burn shit down I’m not picky)
	   
	2. Don't make money out of my work
	   if you want to use my work for a project, ask me before. If your project will gather money, it may be likely i will say no
	   Unless it is for BiPOC, lgbtqi+ and/or disabled ppl, then i will likely say yes
	
	2. Don’t be an ass.
	   Like don’t pretend its your original work, don’t use this to oppress people, don’t extort money from poor people, and in fact if
	   you have more money than you need GIVE THE SHIT OUT OF IT to BiPOC, lgbtqi+ & disabled ppl.
	   just don’t keep what you don’t need we’re in enough shit already. thanks.
	
	3. Don’t be a fascist.
	   Don't be a mysoginist.
	   Don't be a racist.
	   Don't be a homophobe.
	   Don't be a transphbe.
	   Don't be a ableist.
	   Don’t be right wing.
	   Don’t be a cop.
	   Don’t be a terf/swerf.
	   Don’t be colonialist.
	
	   Right wing people are high with power and selfishness and individualist and fascist just need to be burned down.
	   If you see one, you are mandated by the present licensing terms to break their kneecaps (unless you can’t ofc)
	   If you’re one of those yourself you know what to do.
	
	   Don’t complain, its of no use I won’t listen.
	
	4. Just fucking listen to people’s experiences and don’t talk over their voices. That’s all, its not THAT hard is it?
	
	5. If you see me just say hi if you feel like it, or ignore me if you want or whatever.
	   I’m not expecting to meet people from the little things I still can do but you never know.
