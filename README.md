# Retroweb_webpage_generator
script to generate webpages for Retroweb from a content database

still work in progress/not really usable

the aim of this script is to make it more easly to mofify the websites on [Retroweb](http://retroweb.nononymous.fr)

the code is avaliable on my [Gitea](https://git.nononymous.fr/nononymous/Retroweb_webpage_generator) instance

if you have any questions about it, like things i could add, modify, remove of if you have trouble or general questions about it, you can ask them on this repo (only used for issues), fediverse or via email (both avaliable on my profile)
